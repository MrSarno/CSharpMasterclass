Well, I guess it's time to learn C#!

This repository is comprised of material covered as part of the excellent [Complete C# Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-csharp-masterclass/) course on Udemy by [Denis Panjuta](https://tutorials.eu/).

Each directory is a distinct project & solution. I am writing code in the Community edition of Visual Studio, with a small amount of testing being done in Rider from the JetBrains suite of IDEs on various Operating Systems.
